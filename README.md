Summary:
Each drug regimen had a large smaple size, the n value was adequet to run the analyses. The distribution of male and female mice was almost equal and it is likely that sex did not infuence the tumor volume size of the treatment drug regimen results. Both Capomulin and Ramicane treatment drug regimens decreased the tumor size in mice. As mouse weight increased you saw an increase in the average tumor volume, there was a positive correltation. This correlation is statistically significant based on the large r value of 0.84 as it is close to +1.
